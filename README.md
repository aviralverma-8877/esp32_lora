# ESP32 + Lora Board.

This board combines an **ESP32 microcontroller** with an **RA-01 LoRa module**. It serves as an alternative to the various LoRa 32 boards already on the market. Designed in a dongle form factor, it allows developers to program it in a plug-and-play manner. This board features onboard header pins, which serve as a versatile interface for connecting and expanding its capabilities. Developers can use these pins to create custom daughterboards that enhance the functionality of the main board. Whether it’s adding sensors, communication modules, or other peripherals, these header pins enable seamless integration and flexibility. Notably, this board supports several open-source projects:

- **Meshtastic**: A project that utilizes inexpensive LoRa radios for long-range off-grid communication in areas without reliable cellular service. Whether you’re hiking, skiing, or paragliding, Meshtastic allows mesh members to send and receive text messages and even enables optional GPS-based location features.
- **TinyGS**: Another open-source initiative that likely extends the capabilities of this board.
- **LoRa-Based APRS**: This project leverages LoRa technology for Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) tracking and communication. It’s an excellent fit for this board’s capabilities.
- **Single Channel LoRa Gateway**: While details are scarce, it’s likely related to creating a simple LoRa gateway using this board.

In summary, this board is a powerful tool for experimenting with LoRa-based communication and mesh networking, making it an exciting choice for hobbyists and developers alike!
